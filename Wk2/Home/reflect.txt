Using public methods to indirectly access data inside the private class I can manipulate things in a safe
way VIA (getters and setters). Const insures that variables cannot be changed within the function/class
incase I made some mistakes itll be easier to debug. The .display(???) function was overloaded to properly
handle dynamic situations within the code. However, I could have used a switch instead. I think
overloading was a better method to handle it.
