1. According to what I've read in books, most modern systems will have their own "safe guards" against
	memory leaks from bad programs. But for the systems that do not have these guards, dynamic memory that is not
	deallocated will never be deallocated for future programs to use until the system is rebooted. If the program
	continues to leak memory it will be harder for the machine to find available space to store memory and thus making
	the machine slower as it has to look longer.

2. Two methods for formating IOStream are setfill('?') which fills empty space to '?' and left which justifies text
	to the left and right which justifies text to the right.

3. Dynamic memory is required because the program does not know how many weather reports are going to inputted by the user.
	The programmer could have pre-allocated a fixed amount of memory for the user so the program would know prior to the user
	inputting the amount, however if the user inputted more reports than the program had already allocated then the program would
	not complete the duties properly. As a bonus as well dynamically allocating memory is great for efficient memory usage during
	run time.
